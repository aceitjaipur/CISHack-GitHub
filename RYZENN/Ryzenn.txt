Project Description :-
      Our project focuses on deploying a technology which can track down
      the illegal shorting practices taking place under the roof of
      stock market.The project will help to stop such practices by
      predicting naked shorting from the quarterly dataset of companies.
      The project is named "".
      The project is built using the following technologies:-
        1. NodeJS
        2. React.js
        3. MySQL
        4. Python
        5. AWS
        6. Tensorflow
      The complete back-end logic is built using NodeJS. Front-end
      is created using React.js. To handle the datasets, MySQL has been
      used. To extract or scrap the data from the internet, a script
      has been created using python. To host the complete project,
      AWS is used.
      The quarterly data for each company is extracted using the
      python script. The extract data is fed into a model in order
      to train the model to predict new and illegal short postions in the
      market by using Tensorflow.
      Our model works on the bases of historical data. This data
      set have many point to work with in the timeline as companies
      make differnt profit and losses in a long term and people have
      jobs to analiys it and our model is going to help them to detemine
      irregularities in the share price futhermore these irregularities
      helps in exploting the loopholes of the stock market to fill the 'pockets'
      of large hedge funds and investment banks to disturbe the economy like the
      2008 financal crisis and our models helps to  predict it and stop it before
      happening
